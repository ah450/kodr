#Kodr

Kodr is an online gamified learning system that teaches programing concepts. It does so through engaging students in challenges.

Supported Challenges
coding challanges, evaluated using bdd styled mocha with chai tests along with static structure evaluation

Users learn by partaking in challenges which gives them experience, awarding them achivements.
Achivments showcase what the student learned and can be used to guide his learning process.
